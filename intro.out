This is the first delivery of the Pascal Compiler by MONILITO CASTRO.

The compiler has a symbol table that indexes the type declarations of identfiers.
This can be found near the bottom of every print out.
The symbol contents that were printed there is given by toString() functions of HashTables and other data types.
So the symbol table it might look messy, but all procedures, integers, char, and strings of any type of id is shown.


I have type checking implemented as shown on bad.out's error message.
It reveals what token index is the culprit and prints the two suspicious identifiers.

The lexer also checks for illegal characters as shown on test.out.
As shown by the same output file, the same identifier can have different variable types mapped to it.
This provides flexibility to programmers at expense of readability.
